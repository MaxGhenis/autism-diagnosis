# Synthesized Referee Reports

## Referee Report 1 (Methods Expert)

### Summary
This paper uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of early autism diagnosis on long-term outcomes. The identification strategy is clever and the results are important for policy.

### Strengths
1. Novel identification strategy using institutional transitions
2. Long-term outcomes rarely studied in this literature
3. Clear presentation of results with appropriate robustness checks
4. Policy relevance is high

### Major Concerns
1. **External Validity**: The RD identifies a local average treatment effect (LATE) at the cutoff. How generalizable is this to children diagnosed at other ages?

2. **Mechanisms**: The paper cannot separate the effect of diagnosis timing from treatment timing. This should be discussed more thoroughly.

3. **Synthetic Data**: While understandable given privacy constraints, the use of synthetic data limits confidence in the findings. The authors should seek real administrative data.

### Minor Issues
- Table 1 should include baseline characteristics by treatment status
- The bandwidth selection procedure could use more justification
- Some citations are missing page numbers
- Figure 1 would benefit from confidence intervals

### Recommendation
**Revise and Resubmit** - Important topic with solid methods, but needs real data for publication.

## Referee Report 2 (Autism Research Expert)

### Summary
The authors examine an important question about autism diagnosis timing using quasi-experimental methods. The RD design is appropriate and well-executed.

### Strengths
1. Addresses selection bias that plagues observational studies
2. Comprehensive outcome measures including adult outcomes
3. Thoughtful discussion of mechanisms
4. Strong policy implications

### Major Concerns
1. **Heterogeneity**: Autism is highly heterogeneous. The average effects may mask important subgroup differences (by severity, co-occurring conditions, etc.)

2. **Service Quality**: The paper assumes early diagnosis leads to early intervention, but service quality varies substantially. Can the authors incorporate this?

3. **Diagnostic Stability**: Some children diagnosed at age 2 no longer meet criteria by age 5. How does this affect interpretation?

### Minor Issues
- The literature review could include more recent meta-analyses
- Discussion of racial/ethnic disparities needs expansion
- Cost-effectiveness analysis would strengthen policy recommendations

### Recommendation
**Accept with Minor Revisions** - Solid contribution that advances the field.

## Referee Report 3 (Health Economist)

### Summary
Well-crafted RD study on an important topic. The identification strategy is credible and the economic implications are substantial.

### Strengths
1. Clean identification exploiting plausibly exogenous variation
2. Multiple outcome domains studied
3. Robust to various specifications
4. Clear writing and presentation

### Major Concerns
1. **Sample Size at Cutoff**: With only 659 treated individuals, power may be limited for heterogeneity analysis. 

2. **Cost Data**: The paper lacks detailed cost analysis. Given the policy focus, costs of early diagnosis/intervention should be included.

3. **General Equilibrium Effects**: If all children were diagnosed early, would the effects persist? Supply constraints in services could attenuate benefits.

### Specific Suggestions
- Add a formal cost-benefit analysis section
- Discuss implementation challenges for universal screening
- Include sensitivity analysis for different discount rates
- Consider fuzzy RD given imperfect compliance

### Recommendation
**Accept with Revisions** - Important findings, but needs economic analysis strengthened.

## Editor's Decision Letter

Dear Authors,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript "Impact of Early Autism Diagnosis on Long-term Outcomes: A Regression Discontinuity Analysis" to the Journal of Health Economics.

The referees agree this is an important topic with a clever identification strategy. However, there are concerns about the use of synthetic data and requests for additional analyses. 

I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to **revise and resubmit** your manuscript, addressing the following key points:

### Required Revisions
1. Obtain and analyze real administrative data if possible, or provide stronger validation of synthetic data
2. Add formal cost-benefit analysis with sensitivity analyses
3. Discuss heterogeneous treatment effects and external validity thoroughly
4. Address diagnostic stability and service quality issues
5. Include confidence intervals in main figure

### Suggested Improvements
- Expand discussion of implementation challenges
- Add subgroup analyses where powered
- Include more recent citations
- Clarify mechanisms section

Please submit your revision within 90 days, along with a detailed response letter addressing each referee comment.

Sincerely,
The Editor

## Authors' Response Strategy

### Major Revisions to Implement
1. **Data**: Partner with state autism registry for real data validation
2. **Cost Analysis**: Add comprehensive cost-benefit section with NPV calculations
3. **Heterogeneity**: Add analyses by gender, baseline severity where possible
4. **External Validity**: Add discussion of LATE interpretation and generalizability

### Quick Wins
- Add confidence intervals to all figures
- Update citations to include 2023-2024 papers
- Create supplement with additional robustness checks
- Add table of baseline characteristics

### Rebuttal Points
- Diagnostic stability: Cite literature showing early diagnosis is generally stable
- Service quality: Argue this is part of the policy-relevant treatment effect
- Sample size: Show power calculations demonstrate adequacy for main effects
