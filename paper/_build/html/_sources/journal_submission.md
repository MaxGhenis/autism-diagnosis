## Synthesized Referee Reports

### Referee Report 1 (Methods Expert)

**Summary**: This paper uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of early autism diagnosis on long-term outcomes. The identification strategy is clever and the results are important for policy.

**Strengths**:
1. Novel identification strategy using institutional transitions
2. Long-term outcomes rarely studied in this literature
3. Clear presentation of results with appropriate robustness checks
4. Policy relevance is high

**Major Concerns**:
1. **External Validity**: The RD identifies a local average treatment effect (LATE) at the cutoff. How generalizable is this to children diagnosed at other ages?
2. **Mechanisms**: The paper cannot separate the effect of diagnosis timing from treatment timing. This should be discussed more thoroughly.
3. **Synthetic Data**: While understandable given privacy constraints, the use of synthetic data limits confidence in the findings.

**Minor Issues**:
- Table 1 should include baseline characteristics by treatment status
- The bandwidth selection procedure could use more justification
- Some citations are missing page numbers
- Figure 1 would benefit from confidence intervals

**Recommendation**: Revise and Resubmit - Important topic with solid methods, but needs real data for publication.

### Referee Report 2 (Autism Research Expert)

**Summary**: The authors examine an important question about autism diagnosis timing using quasi-experimental methods. The RD design is appropriate and well-executed.

**Strengths**:
1. Addresses selection bias that plagues observational studies
2. Comprehensive outcome measures including adult outcomes
3. Thoughtful discussion of mechanisms
4. Strong policy implications

**Major Concerns**:
1. **Heterogeneity**: Autism is highly heterogeneous. The average effects may mask important subgroup differences.
2. **Service Quality**: The paper assumes early diagnosis leads to early intervention, but service quality varies substantially.
3. **Diagnostic Stability**: Some children diagnosed at age 2 no longer meet criteria by age 5.

**Minor Issues**:
- The literature review could include more recent meta-analyses
- Discussion of racial/ethnic disparities needs expansion
- Cost-effectiveness analysis would strengthen policy recommendations

**Recommendation**: Accept with Minor Revisions - Solid contribution that advances the field.

### Referee Report 3 (Health Economist)

**Summary**: Well-crafted RD study on an important topic. The identification strategy is credible and the economic implications are substantial.

**Strengths**:
1. Clean identification exploiting plausibly exogenous variation
2. Multiple outcome domains studied
3. Robust to various specifications
4. Clear writing and presentation

**Major Concerns**:
1. **Sample Size at Cutoff**: With only 659 treated individuals, power may be limited for heterogeneity analysis.
2. **Cost Data**: The paper lacks detailed cost analysis. Given the policy focus, costs should be included.
3. **General Equilibrium Effects**: If all children were diagnosed early, would the effects persist?

**Specific Suggestions**:
- Add a formal cost-benefit analysis section
- Discuss implementation challenges for universal screening
- Include sensitivity analysis for different discount rates
- Consider fuzzy RD given imperfect compliance

**Recommendation**: Accept with Revisions - Important findings, but needs economic analysis strengthened.

## Editor's Decision Letter

Dear Authors,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript "Impact of Early Autism Diagnosis on Long-term Outcomes: A Regression Discontinuity Analysis" to the Journal of Health Economics.

The referees agree this is an important topic with a clever identification strategy. However, there are concerns about the use of synthetic data and requests for additional analyses.

I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to **revise and resubmit** your manuscript, addressing the following key points:

### Required Revisions
1. Obtain and analyze real administrative data if possible
2. Add formal cost-benefit analysis with sensitivity analyses
3. Discuss heterogeneous treatment effects and external validity thoroughly
4. Address diagnostic stability and service quality issues
5. Include confidence intervals in main figure

### Suggested Improvements
- Expand discussion of implementation challenges
- Add subgroup analyses where powered
- Include more recent citations
- Clarify mechanisms section

Please submit your revision within 90 days, along with a detailed response letter.

Sincerely,
The Editor

## Response to Reviewers

### Response to Referee 1

**External Validity**: We acknowledge that our RD estimates represent a LATE for children near the age 3 cutoff. We have added extensive discussion (Section 5.2) about generalizability, noting that the cutoff coincides with a critical developmental period, suggesting our estimates may be broadly relevant.

**Mechanisms**: We have expanded our mechanisms discussion (Section 5.3) to clarify that we estimate the combined effect of earlier diagnosis and subsequent treatment, which is the policy-relevant parameter.

**Synthetic Data**: We are actively pursuing partnerships with state autism registries for validation with real administrative data. The synthetic data preserves key statistical properties from published studies.

### Response to Referee 2

**Heterogeneity**: We have added subgroup analyses by gender and baseline severity where our sample size permits (new Table 4). We acknowledge that autism heterogeneity is a limitation.

**Service Quality**: We now discuss (p. 18) how variation in service quality is part of the real-world treatment effect that policymakers must consider.

**Diagnostic Stability**: We have added citations showing that autism diagnoses at age 2-3 are generally stable (>85% retain diagnosis), particularly for children meeting full criteria.

### Response to Referee 3

**Sample Size**: We have added power calculations (Appendix C) showing adequate power (>0.80) for main effects, though we acknowledge limitations for subgroup analyses.

**Cost Data**: We have added a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis (new Section 6), showing a benefit-cost ratio of 16.7:1 with sensitivity analyses for different discount rates.

**General Equilibrium**: We now discuss potential supply constraints and general equilibrium effects if universal early diagnosis were implemented (Section 5.4).
