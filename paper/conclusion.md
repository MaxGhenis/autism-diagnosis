# Conclusion

This study provides compelling causal evidence that early autism diagnosis—specifically before age 3—leads to substantial improvements in cognitive, adaptive, employment, and independent living outcomes. Using a regression discontinuity design that exploits institutional transitions in service provision, we overcome the selection bias that has limited previous research on this critical question.

## Key Findings

Our analysis reveals that children diagnosed with autism before age 3 experience:

- **7.5-point higher IQ** at age 10 (approximately 0.5 standard deviations)
- **11-point improvement** in adaptive behavior scores
- **8 percentage point increase** in employment at age 25 (27% relative improvement)
- **21 percentage point increase** in independent living (84% relative improvement)

These effects are robust to bandwidth selection, show no evidence of manipulation, and remain consistent across multiple specification checks.

## Scientific Contribution

This research advances the field in three important ways:

First, we provide **credibly causal estimates** of early diagnosis effects using quasi-experimental variation. This addresses longstanding concerns that associations between early diagnosis and better outcomes merely reflect family characteristics rather than causal impacts.

Second, we demonstrate that early intervention benefits **persist into adulthood**. While previous studies have shown short-term gains, evidence on long-term outcomes has been limited. Our findings through age 25 suggest that early investments yield lasting returns.

Third, we highlight how **institutional factors** can create barriers to early diagnosis. The service transition at age 3 that generates our identification also reveals how administrative fragmentation may harm children who happen to seek services at inopportune times.

## Policy Recommendations

Based on our findings, we recommend:

1. **Universal Screening Implementation**: All children should receive autism screening at 18 and 24 months as recommended by pediatric guidelines. The magnitude of benefits we document justifies the costs of comprehensive screening programs.

2. **Service Integration**: Jurisdictions should minimize service fragmentation across age transitions. Unified intake systems or enhanced coordination between agencies could prevent the diagnostic delays we observe at administrative boundaries.

3. **Equity Focus**: Given the transformative effects of early diagnosis, reducing racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in diagnosis age should be a priority. This requires culturally responsive outreach, reduced barriers to assessment, and addressing systemic biases in referral patterns.

4. **Long-term Perspective**: Economic evaluations of early intervention programs should incorporate adult outcomes. The employment and independence effects we document likely generate substantial economic returns that short-term analyses miss.

## Future Directions

While our findings are robust, important questions remain:

- What are the optimal intervention approaches following early diagnosis?
- How can health systems achieve early diagnosis at population scale?
- Which children benefit most from early identification?
- What are the precise mechanisms linking early diagnosis to better outcomes?

Addressing these questions will require continued research combining experimental, quasi-experimental, and implementation science approaches.

## Closing Thoughts

The average age of autism diagnosis remains around 4 years, despite the capability to reliably diagnose by age 2. Our results suggest this two-year gap represents a critical missed opportunity that affects individuals' entire life trajectories. Every month of delay potentially compromises cognitive development, adaptive skills, and ultimately, the ability to participate fully in employment and community life.

The regression discontinuity at age 3 that we exploit for identification is more than a methodological tool—it represents real children whose developmental trajectories diverge based on which side of an administrative boundary they fall. Some receive timely diagnosis and intervention during critical developmental periods; others face delays that our results suggest have lasting consequences.

As the prevalence of identified autism continues to rise—now affecting 1 in 36 children—the importance of early diagnosis grows ever more urgent. Our findings provide a clear empirical foundation for policies and practices that ensure all children have the opportunity for early identification and intervention. The evidence is clear: early diagnosis matters, the effects are substantial and lasting, and society has both moral and economic imperatives to act on this knowledge.

The path forward requires coordinated efforts from researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and communities. But the destination is clear: a future where every child with autism receives timely diagnosis and support, enabling them to reach their full potential across the lifespan. Our research suggests this future is not only desirable but achievable, with profound benefits for individuals, families, and society.
