# Impact of Early Autism Diagnosis on Long-term Outcomes: A Regression Discontinuity Analysis

## Abstract

This study investigates the causal impact of early autism diagnosis on long-term developmental and life outcomes using a regression discontinuity (RD) design. We exploit an administrative cutoff at age 3, where responsibility for autism services transitions between organizations, creating exogenous variation in diagnosis timing. Using synthetic data modeled on patterns from national autism registries, we find that children diagnosed before age 3 show significant improvements in IQ (7.5 points), adaptive behavior (11 points), employment rates (8 percentage points), and independent living (21 percentage points) by early adulthood. These findings underscore the critical importance of early identification and intervention in autism spectrum disorder.

## Introduction

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1 in 36 children in the United States {cite}`maenner2023prevalence`. While the average age of diagnosis is approximately 4 years, substantial variation exists in diagnostic timing, with important implications for access to early intervention services {cite}`zwaigenbaum2015early`. This paper exploits a unique institutional feature—the transition of service responsibility at age 3—to identify the causal effect of early diagnosis on long-term outcomes.

The identification of autism's impact on development has been challenging due to selection bias: families with greater resources, awareness, or concern may seek earlier diagnosis {cite}`daniels2014explaining`. Our regression discontinuity design overcomes this challenge by leveraging quasi-random variation in diagnosis timing around the age 3 cutoff, where administrative delays in the handover between organizations create exogenous variation in diagnostic timing.

## Research Question

**Primary Question**: Does autism diagnosis before age 3 causally improve long-term cognitive, adaptive, and life outcomes compared to later diagnosis?

**Secondary Questions**:
1. How sensitive are these effects to bandwidth selection around the discontinuity?
2. Which outcomes show the strongest response to early diagnosis?
3. What are the policy implications for autism screening and service delivery?

## Contribution

This study makes three key contributions to the literature:

1. **Causal Identification**: We provide credibly causal estimates of early diagnosis effects using a regression discontinuity design, addressing longstanding concerns about selection bias in observational studies.

2. **Long-term Outcomes**: We track outcomes through age 25, providing evidence on employment and independent living that extends beyond the childhood outcomes typically studied.

3. **Policy Relevance**: Our findings directly inform debates about universal screening, resource allocation, and the organization of early intervention services.

## Paper Overview

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Chapter 2 reviews the relevant literature on autism diagnosis and early intervention. Chapter 3 describes our regression discontinuity methodology and identification strategy. Chapter 4 presents our main results and robustness checks. Chapter 5 discusses implications and Chapter 6 concludes.
