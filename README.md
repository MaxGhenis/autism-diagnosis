# Autism Diagnosis Age and Long-term Outcomes Study

## Research Question
Examining the impact of autism diagnosis age on long-term outcomes using a regression discontinuity design at age 3.

## Identification Strategy
We exploit a discontinuity at age 3 when a different organization takes over autism services, creating exogenous variation in diagnosis timing.
